	<h4>A mood board for when you don't know what to wear, because dressing yourself in NYC is hard sometimes.</h4>

	<h5> Sneakers are a great way to go if you're running around NYC and want to stay comfortable but cute! </h5>

	<img src="floralb.jpeg" alt="Image of a girl leaning against a white wall, she is wearing a red, yellow, and blue floral dress that hits just above her ankles. She has matching yellow shoes that are women, and her arm is raised above her head.">
	<br/>
	<h6> Stuck on what to wear? Me too. Throw on a sundress for something that's low-maintence and fun, but still looks like you tried.</h6>

	<h6>Stop bending over backwards for outfits that don't make you feel great in your own body!</h6>

	<h7> All black is the way to go if you don't want to bother with matching colors! Become a true New Yorker ;) </h7>

	<img src="blue.jpeg" alt="Image of a girl posing on a set of stairs in front of a blue door. Her right foot is stepping down, and her right arm is extended. Her left arm is touching her ear. She is wearing a light blue coat, high waisted blue skinny jeans and black boots.">

	<h8> Monochrome is having a moment! Wearing all one color makes it super easy to mix and match pieces you wouldn't typically think of wearing together!
